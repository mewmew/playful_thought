*focus*: type analysis, constraint programming

## Expression Recovery from Static Single Assignment Form using Data Flow Analysis

*focus*: data flow analysis

## Evaluation of Methods for Symbolic Execution of LLVM IR

*focus*: symbolic execution

## Profile Guided Fuzzing of LLVM IR

*focus*: code coverage aware fuzzing, automated LLVM IR generation from BNF grammar

## A BNF Grammar for LLVM IR

*focus*: BNF grammar

## 2-dimensional Constraint Discovery in Procedurally Generated Maps

*focus*: constraint inference/learning/discovery

## Enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege with Capabilities Aware Compilation

*focus*: capabilities aware compilation
