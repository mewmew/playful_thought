    focus: control flow analysis, define metric for effective control flow recovery

3. Type Recovery using Constraint Solvers

    focus: type analysis, constraint programming

4. Expression Recovery from Static Single Assignment Form using Data Flow Analysis

    focus: data flow analysis

5. Evaluation of Methods for Symbolic Execution of LLVM IR

    focus: static execution

6. Profile Guided Fuzzing of LLVM IR

    focus: code coverage aware fuzzing, automated LLVM IR generation from BNF grammar

7. A BNF Grammar for LLVM IR
